# Neural-ATTF-Python-Simulator
This is the Python simulator branch. This branch provides a folder with a pipeline for the Neural ATTF simulations using Robotarium Python simulator.

## Test Platform
1. Hardware: Windows 11
2. Python 3.11.9

## Prerequisites
1. Install [Robotarium Python simulator](https://github.com/robotarium/robotarium_python_simulator).
2. Copy `my_tests` folder from this repository inside the Robotarium Python simulator. The simulator directory would appear as below:
  ```
  robotarium_python_simulator/
  ├── my_tests/
  │ ├── config.yaml
  │ ├── env.json
  │ ├── generate_submission.py
  │ ├── local_script_test1.py
  │ ├── schedule.json
  │ ├── utility.py
  │ └── warehouse_image.png
  ├── robotarium_python_simulator.egg-info
  ├── rps
  ├── LICENSE
  ├── README.md
  └── setup.py
  ```

## File description:
1. `config.yaml`: Contains the tunable parameters for the experiments.
2. `env.json`: Contains the environment data for Neural ATTF -- agent names and their start positions, number of delays per agent, total number of tasks, tasks with their frequency, start time, and waypoints, and environment map with its dimensions, non-task endpoints, and static obstacles.
3. `generate_submission.py`: Creates a folder of files inside the current working directory. These files can be uploaded to the Robotarium portal for real-world experiments.
4. `local_script_test1.py`: This is the main file for running the simulations locally.
5. `schedule.json`: Contains the schedule data generated by Neural ATTF -- path plan for each agent at each time step, number of replans, and completed times for each task.
6. `utility.py`: Contains all the helper functions required to complete simulations and real-world experiments.
7. `warehouse_image.png`: This is the background image, placed on the Robotarium simulator and the actual arena during the experiment.

## Usage
1. Tune the parameters in `config.yaml`.
2. Run `local_script_test1.py` for simulations and review the debug logs at the end of the simulations.
3. If debug logs don't have any collisions, run `generate_submission.py` and create a folder of files.
4. Upload all the files created by `generate_submission.py` on the Robotarium portal and select `main.py` as the main file.
5. Review the video after the Robotarium experiment.
